Since technology workers are in high demand and generally short supply, companies will often bend over backwards to entice workers to join them, by offering high salaries, fun offices and good food.</p>

                           <p>One of the largest misconceptions regarding computer science is that it’s merely the art of smashing away at keyboards in cubicles. This program is geared towards showing students the workplace of a company at the cutting edge: bright offices filled with food, unorthodox decoration, and a productive, happy workforce. It’s this idea that the program intends to show to students, and hopefully entices more computer science students with.</p>

                        <br />    
                           <p>Most trips take place on weekdays around 9 o’clock as many companies are closed over the weekend. Beginning with a guided tour at the first company, students will be able to shadow developers and observe firsthand the workday at a tech company. Around noon, students leave the company and head to a nearby restaurant for lunch. YCPC does not organize transportation, but is able to reserve restaurants within walking distance. Students will then attend the next company and repeat the process as before. The tour will end around 5 PM, and students will get home around 5:30 PM.</p>

                             <p>We do request that the school provide transportation to and from the offices. Due to liability issues, the organization is unable to organize such services for the students. Although we do try to make sure that companies and restaurants are within walking distance of each other, commute between the trip location and the school may vary to up to half an hour.</p>
